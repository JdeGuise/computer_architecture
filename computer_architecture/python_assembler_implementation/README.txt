# Python Assembler Fall 2015
John deGuise


in:  HACK assembly language in .asm or .cmp format

out: HACK machine language in .hack format


Code was built on OS X and with Python 2.7.  All of the .asm/.cmp files are meant to be in the same level of directory as the python code.

To run, navigate to the root of python_assembler_implementation; Assembler can be executed as standard in a Terminal format: “python Assembler.py Pong.asm” -> generates a Pong.hack in same directory level.
